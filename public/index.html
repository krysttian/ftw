        <h3>The Impact</h3>
        <p>
          Almost 2 Million Floridians have their license suspended.<a target="_blank" href="https://finesandfeesjusticecenter.org/articles/driving-on-empty-florida-driver-license-suspension-fines-fees/">[1]</a>
          In 2017, over 1.1 million suspension notices, making up nearly 72% of all suspension notices that year, were for unpaid fines and fees, not for dangerous driving or public safety concerns. <a href="https://finesandfeesjusticecenter.org/campaigns/florida-campaign-fines-fees/">[2]</a>
